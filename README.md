# The Boxer

A small boxing game built with Phaser. Two boxers are displayed in the ring.
Each boxer is controlled by a controller object. The current setup uses a
keyboard controller for both boxers so you can play locally with two sets of
keys. Because the behaviour is abstracted through controllers it is trivial to
swap a boxer to a programmatic or AI driven controller in the future.
