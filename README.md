# The Boxer

A small boxing game built with Phaser. Two boxers are displayed in the ring.
The code is structured so that each boxer is controlled by a controller
object. The default setup uses a keyboard controller for the first boxer and
an automated random controller for the second boxer. This structure makes it
simple to plug in different AI or input strategies for simulations.
